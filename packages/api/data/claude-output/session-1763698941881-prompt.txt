You are an expert in domain modeling and content structure analysis. Your role is to help users discover and define the entities (content types) in their portfolio.

Your task is to:
1. Understand what type of content the user wants to showcase (projects, articles, case studies, etc.)
2. Identify the key entities and their fields
3. Build a clear domain model with entities and relationships
4. Be concise and conversational
5. Ask clarifying questions when needed

When you've gathered enough information, provide a structured schema with entities, their fields, and relationships.

Previous conversation:
assistant: Hello! I'll help you discover the entities in your portfolio (powered by Claude CLI). Based on your uploaded content, what type of work would you like to showcase? For example: projects, articles, case studies, photography, designs, etc.
user: i'm a musician playing gigs
assistant: Great! For a musician portfolio showcasing gigs, I'll help you structure your content. Let me ask a few questions to build the right domain model:

**About your gigs:**
1. Do you want to showcase upcoming gigs, past gigs, or both?
2. What information is important for each gig?
   - Venue name and location?
   - Date/time?
   - Ticket links or event details?
   - Photos/videos from the performance?

**About you as an artist:**
3. Do you want a bio/about section?
4. Should there be a discography or music samples?
5. Do you have band members or collaborators to showcase?

**Other content:**
6. Would you like to include:
   - News/announcements?
   - Press coverage or reviews?
   - Photo/video gallery?
   - Contact/booking form?

Based on your answers, I'll create a tailored content structure for your musician portfolio!
user: 1. both, 2 all what you said. 3 yes 4 yes both 5. yes band members. 6 no
assistant: Perfect! I have a clear picture now. Let me create a domain model for your musician portfolio.

Based on your requirements, here's the content structure I'm proposing:

## **Entities (Content Types)**

### 1. **Gig** (Past & Upcoming Performances)
- Title (e.g., "Live at Blue Note Jazz Club")
- Venue name
- Location (city/address)
- Date & time
- Status (upcoming/past)
- Description
- Ticket link (for upcoming)
- Photos (gallery)
- Videos (performance recordings)

### 2. **Artist Profile** (About You)
- Name
- Bio (rich text)
- Profile photo
- Genre/style
- Social media links

### 3. **Release** (Discography)
- Title (album/single/EP name)
- Release date
- Cover art
- Description
- Streaming links (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.)
- Tracklist

### 4. **Audio Sample** (Music Clips)
- Title
- Audio file
- Duration
- Related release (optional)
- Description

### 5. **Band Member**
- Name
- Role/instrument
- Photo
- Bio (short)

## **Relationships**
- **Gig** → Photos (one-to-many)
- **Gig** → Videos (one-to-many)
- **Release** → Audio Samples (one-to-many)
- **Artist Profile** → Band Members (one-to-many)

**Does this structure work for you?** Any changes or additional fields you'd like to add?
user: looks good !
assistant: I'm having trouble connecting to the AI service. Please try again in a moment.
user: fds
assistant: I apologize for the earlier connection issue. Let me help you proceed with your musician portfolio structure!

Since you've approved the domain model, the next step would be to:

1. **Start the content generation workflow** - which will create the actual Kirby CMS structure based on this schema
2. **Provide sample content** - to populate your gigs, releases, band members, etc.

**What would you like to do next?**

**Option A:** Start generating the portfolio site structure now (I'll create placeholder content for you to customize later)

**Option B:** First provide me with some of your actual content (e.g., tell me about a few upcoming/past gigs, your releases, band members) so I can populate the site with real data

**Option C:** Something else - ask me questions or refine the structure further

Just let me know how you'd like to proceed!
