You are an expert in domain modeling and content structure analysis. Your role is to help users discover and define the entities (content types) in their portfolio.

Your task is to:
1. Understand what type of content the user wants to showcase (projects, articles, case studies, etc.)
2. Identify the key entities and their fields
3. Build a clear domain model with entities and relationships
4. Be concise and conversational
5. Ask clarifying questions when needed

When you've gathered enough information, provide a structured schema with entities, their fields, and relationships.

Previous conversation:
assistant: Hello! I'll help you discover the entities in your portfolio (powered by Claude CLI). Based on your uploaded content, what type of work would you like to showcase? For example: projects, articles, case studies, photography, designs, etc.
user: i do gigs and websites
assistant: Great! So you do both **gigs** (freelance work, one-off projects) and **websites** (web development/design projects). Let me help you structure this.

A few questions to build the right model:

**1. Are gigs and websites separate types of work, or is "website" a type of gig?**
   - Option A: Separate (e.g., "Gigs" = design work, consulting; "Websites" = web projects)
   - Option B: Related (e.g., all work items are "Gigs", but some gigs are website projects)

**2. What information do you typically show for each?**
   - Title/name of the project?
   - Description or case study?
   - Client name?
   - Technologies/tools used?
   - Images/screenshots?
   - Date or timeline?
   - Link to live site (for websites)?
   - Anything else important?

**3. Do you categorize your work further?**
   - By industry (e.g., e-commerce, portfolio sites, corporate)?
   - By type (e.g., design vs development, frontend vs full-stack)?
   - By size (small gig vs large project)?

Let me know and I'll build a clear domain model for your portfolio!
user: music gigs, and websites. for music gigs : event, date, location, recording, lineup, fee. for website: client, technology, descripion,date.
assistant: Perfect! I now have a clear picture. You have **two distinct types of work**: music gigs and website projects.

Let me confirm the structure:

## **Entities**

### 1. **Music Gig**
- Event name
- Date
- Location
- Recording (audio/video link or file?)
- Lineup (your role + other performers?)
- Fee

### 2. **Website**
- Client name
- Technology/stack
- Description
- Date (launch date or project date?)

---

### Quick clarifications:

1. **Recording** - Is this a link (YouTube, SoundCloud) or an uploaded file?
2. **Lineup** - Should this be a text field or structured (e.g., list of band members with roles)?
3. **Technology** - Free text or predefined tags (React, WordPress, etc.)?
4. **Do you want images/photos for either type?** (e.g., venue photos for gigs, screenshots for websites)
5. **Any relationships?** For example:
   - Multiple gigs at the same venue?
   - Multiple websites for the same client?
   - Shared technologies across websites?

Once you confirm, I'll generate the final domain model schema!
user: 1. to soundcloud.2. list of band 3.predefined tags4.yes.5.yes
assistant: Perfect! I've got all the details. Here's your **final domain model**:

---

## **Entities & Fields**

### **1. Music Gig**
- **Event** (text) - Name of the event/performance
- **Date** (date)
- **Location** (text) - Venue name or address
- **Recording** (URL) - SoundCloud link
- **Lineup** (list) - Band members/performers
- **Fee** (number) - Payment received
- **Photos** (images) - Event/venue photos

### **2. Website**
- **Client** (text) - Client name
- **Technology** (tags) - Predefined tech stack (React, WordPress, Node.js, etc.)
- **Description** (text) - Project overview
- **Date** (date) - Launch or completion date
- **Screenshots** (images) - Project visuals

---

## **Relationships**

### **3. Venue** (for music gigs)
- **Name** (text)
- **Location** (text)
- **Gigs** → Many-to-one relationship (multiple gigs can happen at the same venue)

### **4. Client** (for websites)
- **Name** (text)
- **Websites** → One-to-many relationship (a client can have multiple websites)

### **5. Technology** (shared across websites)
- **Name** (text) - e.g., "React", "WordPress", "Tailwind CSS"
- **Websites** → Many-to-many relationship (websites can use multiple technologies)

## **Structure Summary**

```
Music Gig
├─ Event, Date, Location, Recording (SoundCloud), Lineup, Fee, Photos
└─ Belongs to → Venue

Website
├─ Client, Technology (tags), Description, Date, Screenshots
├─ Belongs to → Client
└─ Uses → Technology (many-to-many)

Venue
└─ Has many → Music Gigs

Client
└─ Has many → Websites

Technology
└─ Used by many → Websites
```

Does this structure look good? If yes, I can now generate the **CMS-agnostic schema** that the system will use to build your portfolio!
user: yes !
assistant: I'm having trouble connecting to the AI service. Please try again in a moment.
user: it should be ok now
assistant: I'm having trouble connecting to the AI service. Please try again in a moment.

User: i think the structure is great. i'd like to add industry to the website category

Assistant:
