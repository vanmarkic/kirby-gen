# Authentication (Simple Token - Development Only)
# IMPORTANT: This must match the AUTH_TOKEN value in the API server's .env
#
# When AUTH_ENABLED=true on API server:
#   - Set this to the same value as backend AUTH_TOKEN
#   - Users will need to enter this password on the login page
#   - Frontend will validate and store token in localStorage
#   - All API requests will include this token in headers
#
# When AUTH_ENABLED=false on API server:
#   - Leave this empty or set to any value (won't be validated)
#   - Login page will still appear but accept any password
#
# For production: Replace with proper JWT-based authentication
